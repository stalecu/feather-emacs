## About The Project

This repo is all about my personal Emacs configuration. This will
serve as my attempt to confront my Emacs bankrupcy and, more
importantly, make it pretty and functional.

The feather in Feather Emacs is a homage to Tcl/Tk, one of my favorite
programming languages, as well as my attempt at making it lightweight.

By no means am I trying to build the next Doom Emacs, Spacemacs etc.,
but I hope it will serve as inspiration to someone out there. Or
me. Who knows?

This will also serve as my own playground for experimenting and
developing LSPs and Tree-sitter grammars.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

I am running on the latest Emacs, so something like Emacs 28.1 would
be great to have (I am on 29.2 at the moment of writing). I will
attempt to make it work on Emacs 28 and 27, but I don't want to go
back further than that for now.
